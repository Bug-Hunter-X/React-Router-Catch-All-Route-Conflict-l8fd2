This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where a catch-all route ('*') interferes with other defined routes.  The problem arises when the catch-all route unintentionally captures paths intended for other, more specific routes. This leads to the catch-all component rendering instead of the correct component. The solution shows how to correctly order routes and potentially use the `useLocation` hook to implement a more robust 404 page.
